## ðŸ§© Project Structure

### ðŸ”¸Frontend
A React-based web application that allows users to create wishlists, connect their wallets, and make donations in any supported token. It handles token selection, liquidity check via pump.fun, swap flow, and visualizes transaction progress and history.

### ðŸ”¸Backend
A Node.js-based API that coordinates swap operations through the pump.fun Swap API, calculates and applies platform fees, manages transaction logs, and interfaces securely with the blockchain for donation execution.

### ðŸ”¸Smart Contracts
Solana smart contracts responsible for generating unique PDA wallets per wishlist, handling incoming token donations, executing swaps, applying fee logic (0.5% for $SOL, 1% for meme coins), and transferring USDC to the designated wishlist wallet.
